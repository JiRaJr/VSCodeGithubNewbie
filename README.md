# VS Code & Github
This is my repo to play with VS Code and Github

## What to expect
A lot of trial and error

1.) I was able to edit in VS Code and push a change
2.) Now I will edit this file so I can pull the changes
3.) Coming bac to this to see if I can create a branch in  VS Code
4.) Create this repository on my MacBook Air
